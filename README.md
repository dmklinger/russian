Small fun little side project, fully searchable Ukrainian dictionary (Ukr -> Eng). A bit messy.

Made because I was a little annoyed by the dearth of resources for Ukrainian learners. All data scraped from wiktionary and [dbnary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/), which helpfully provides many, many definitions for words that do not have entries yet in Wiktionary. Forms filled in from [here](https://lcorp.ulif.org.ua/dictua/dictua.aspx), where a match was found.

Frontend gratiously hosted by github pages: https://dmklinger.github.io/ukrainian/

To get the data yourself run `main.py` in `etl/`. Requires a lot of time and a decent amount of RAM.
