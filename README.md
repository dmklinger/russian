Small fun little side project, fully searchable Russian dictionary (Rus -> Eng). A bit messy.

Adjusted from my Ukrainian dictionary, located [here](https://github.com/dmklinger/ukrainian). 

All data scraped from wiktionary and [dbnary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/), which helpfully provides many, many definitions for words that do not have entries yet in Wiktionary. 

Frontend gratiously hosted by github pages: https://dmklinger.github.io/russian

To get the data yourself run `main.py` in `etl/`. Requires a lot of time and a decent amount of RAM.
